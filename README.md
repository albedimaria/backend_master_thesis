# EssentialSounds: Innovative 3D Music Sample Filtering
## Reimagine Music Interaction and Visualization in Real-time with React (frontend-thesis project)

EssentialSounds is a project that aims to change the way we visualize music samples. This repository houses the groundbreaking codebase that combines 
the power of Python's backend with React's frontend to bring you unparalleled 3D music sample visualization and an innovative filtering system.
The main features of this project are the following:

* complete feature extraction using Essentia library
* a new way of filtering and visualizing music samples in real-time
* the possibility to handle up to 50 samples simultaneously

## known issues (work in progress)
* the first instance of the sphere is repeated four times due to the implementation. Should be just one.
* The features on this axis cannot be freely chosen; it was necessary to split them manually.
* The colors are not under control; they appear or do not appear randomly. The colors should always be visible.

  
## improvements 
* drag and drop to add more samples while running the system.
* adding the sound when clicking on spheres.
* instructions for the user through a pop-up.
